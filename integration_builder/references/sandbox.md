# SANDBOX — the `fastn.*` runtime contract

> Read this when writing or debugging workflow code (`create_workflow`, `update_workflow`, `run_code`). Covers what exists in the sandbox, what doesn't, execution tiers, and direct HTTP execution.

Workflows are JavaScript modules running in an isolated V8 sandbox against real third-party APIs — treat every live call as writing to a customer's production system.

## Module shape
Every code string MUST be a single ES module:
```js
export default async function (ctx) {
  const { input, headers } = ctx;
  // ...
  return { result };
}
```
`ctx` has EXACTLY two fields: `ctx.input` (caller data) and `ctx.headers` (sanitized; auth headers stripped). `ctx.log`, `ctx.env`, `ctx.secrets`, `ctx.connectors` do NOT exist.

## WHAT EXISTS
- `fastn` and `Fastn` are ambient globals. **NEVER write import statements** — not even `import { Fastn } from "@fastn/sdk"`. There is no module loader.
- `fastn.connector.<slug>.<action>(args)` — every call returns `{ output, success, status, error, durationMs }`. **ALWAYS unwrap `.output`** for the data (`result.output.results`, never `result.results`) — forgetting this is the single most common bug. Failed calls throw; use try/catch for graceful fallback.
  - **PASS THE ACTION'S ARGUMENT OBJECT DIRECTLY — NEVER nest it under `input`.** `args` is the action's OWN parameters (`$top`, `$select`, `entitySet`, `limit`, `id`, …) — it is **not** `ctx.input`, and **not** the `run_code` / `probe_connector` tool's `input`/`params` field. Nesting them silently drops every parameter: the connector gets one unknown key `input`, ignores your query params, falls back to a bare list against the service root, and **times out**.
    ```js
    // ✅ RIGHT — the args object is passed directly
    await fastn.connector.d365.listProducts({ entitySet: "products", $top: 1, $select: "id,name" });
    // ❌ WRONG — nested under input; $top/$select/entitySet are ignored → service-root call → timeout
    await fastn.connector.d365.listProducts({ input: { entitySet: "products", $top: 1, $select: "id,name" } });
    ```
  - **CHECK THE ACTION CONTRACT FIRST — `get_action_schema` before the FIRST call.** Before you `run_code` / `probe_connector` / `execute_action` against any action, read `get_action_schema` to learn its exact param names, types, and required set, and pass args that match. A wrong or missing required arg does NOT fail cleanly — the gateway returns a terse, often unhelpful error (a bare timeout, `Missing required input fields: …`, or a silent fall-through to a service-root call), each costing a debug round-trip. The schema tells you WHAT to send; a real 2xx still proves it WORKS (schemas can be wrong — see BUILD step 4), so check the contract, then probe.
- **COMMUNITY connectors** (`scope === "community"` from `list_connectors`) are NOT reachable via the bare form. Declare them:
  ```js
  const fastn = new Fastn({ connectors: { hubspotCrm: { orgId: "managed" } } });
  await fastn.connector.hubspotCrm.listContacts({});
  ```
  If you use `new Fastn({ connectors })` anywhere, declare EVERY connector the workflow calls in that config (custom ones use `orgId: "custom"`). Probes in `run_code` follow the same rule — a community connector probed via the bare form fails with "Connector not found".
  Per-connector options are `{ orgId: "managed"|"custom", connectionId, version }`. A code-level `connectionId` pin forces an EXACT connection (top of the resolution precedence) — use it ONLY for throwaway probes / `run_code`, never in saved workflow code; in a saved workflow, pin a non-default connection on the **manifest** with `set_connector_scope` instead (see `references/multi-tenancy.md` §3–§4).
- `fastn.state` — durable key-value: `.get(key)` / `.set(key, value)` / `.delete(key)`. Default ORG scope persists across runs — correct for cursors and ID maps; omit the scope option for those. `{ scope: "INVOCATION" }` resets per run. For a sync's per-record entry store `{ target_id, hash, status, data }` where `status` is `created` | `updated` | `skipped` | `deleted` (the last-sync outcome) and `data` is the record itself as last seen — together the audit trail plus what drives diffing and delete detection (CACHE CONTRACT / UPSERT ORDER in `references/workflow-patterns.md`).
- `fastn.db` — org-scoped SQL: `await fastn.db.query("SELECT ... WHERE x = $1", [v])` — always `$1` placeholders, never string interpolation. `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` allowed; tables persist. This is the **workspace database** (managed Postgres), NOT the DB connector.
- `fastn.cache` — Redis-backed cache: `.get(key, { scope: "PROJECT" })` / `.set(key, value, { ttl: seconds, scope: "PROJECT" })` / `.invalidate(key, { scope: "PROJECT" })`. PROJECT scope persists across executions within the org. Default TTL 300s. Platform singleton Redis (sub-ms, no connection overhead). Use for caching reference data — NOT the Redis connector.
- `fastn.secrets.get(name)` — vault secrets. Never hardcode credentials.
- `fastn.files` — `.write(path, data)` / `.read(path)` / `.delete(path)` / `.exists(path)`. Text content only.
- `fastn.config.get(configId)` + `fastn.evaluator` (`evaluateConditions` / `applyMappings` / `applyDefaults`) — runtime-editable integration config. Returns the object EXACTLY as saved (nested shape) — `config.entities[]` (each entry has `source:{connector,entity}`, `target:{connector,entity}`, `integrationScope`, `mappings[]`, `conditions[]`, `actions[]`) and top-level `config.matching` — access it directly, no unwrapping (full example, incl. the `config.directions` legacy fallback: "How the config comes back in the flow" in `references/dynamic-config.md`). Sync workflows built from a PHASE 1/2 plan ALWAYS read their single `configId` this way, and so does a single-system automation that carries business rules (its filter and selected value live in the config, not in the code). Only a workflow with nothing a user would retune — a fixed notification, a parameterless job — has no config.
- `fastn.config.getByTemplate(templateId)` — the **multi-tenant** read. Returns the SAME shape as `.get`, but resolves the **caller's per-customer clone** at runtime (installation → its clone; else end-org → its clone; else the developer's template in dev). A multi-tenant (Path B) flow MUST use this, not `.get(configId)` — `.get` always returns the partner's template, so every customer would read the developer's mapping instead of their own (a silent cross-tenant bug). Single-tenant (Path A) flows that bind to one developer-owned config use `.get(configId)`. The agent authors the config **template** only; the embed mints the clones. Path/template model: `references/multi-tenancy.md` §10.
- `fastn.envConfig.get(key, env?)` — read a static per-environment key/value (JSONB). **Always `await`** the call; forgetting the keyword silently passes a Promise downstream so the workflow reads `[object Promise]` instead of the value. Default (no second arg) resolves against `ctx.env`; pass an env slug to read a specific env. NOT a secret store — tokens, API keys, OAuth client secrets belong in `fastn.secrets`. Distinct from `fastn.config.get(cfg_*)`: `config` holds the **integration's mappings** (one row per use case, edited via the widget); `envConfig` holds **static per-env values** like API base URLs, retry limits, feature flags, or derived caches a workflow maintains (separate row per `(env_slug, key)`, edited via the dashboard's Configurations tab, written from skills via `bulk_upsert_env_configs`, or written at runtime by workflow code via `fastn.envConfig.set`).
  ```js
  export default async function (ctx) {
    const apiBase = await fastn.envConfig.get("apiBaseUrl");   // resolves against ctx.env
    return { runningIn: ctx.env, apiBase };
  }
  ```
- `fastn.envConfig.set(key, value, env?)` — **upsert** a static per-env config row from inside workflow code. One call creates OR updates: under the hood it's `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (org_id, env_slug, key) DO UPDATE`. Default `env` is `ctx.env`; pass a slug to target a specific env. Invalidates the per-execution read cache so a subsequent `.get` in the same run returns the fresh value. **Requires the executing JWT to carry the `workflows.update` role** (developer / admin / owner / platform_admin) — end_user, viewer, and operator can read but cannot write, and a missing role throws `UserCodeError` before the DB write. Use this for workflows whose job is to POPULATE env-configs from an external source (e.g. a Google Sheet → mapping config; a remote attribute list → key/value cache; any "fetch external data and store it as named config" pattern). Standard write shape:
  ```js
  export default async function (ctx) {
    const rows = await fastn.connector.googleSheets.getRows({ /* ... */ });
    const mapping = buildMapping(rows.output.rows);

    // create OR update — single call; idempotent.
    await fastn.envConfig.set("mappingSheet", mapping);

    // target a specific env explicitly if not ctx.env:
    await fastn.envConfig.set("mappingSheet", mapping, "live");

    return { ok: true, keys: Object.keys(mapping).length };
  }
  ```
- `fastn.envConfig.delete(key, env?)` — remove a row. Same RBAC as `set`. Subsequent `.get(key)` returns `null`.

**Provisioning vs runtime writes — keep them separate.** This skill does NOT call `bulk_upsert_env_configs` / `upsert_env_config` / `create_environment` during BUILD (see BUILD ORDER step 3 in `references/build.md`) — BUILD-time provisioning is the operator's job (dashboard Configurations tab). RUNTIME writes from workflow code are different: when the workflow's actual purpose is to populate or maintain an env-config (a mapping sheet sync, a cached lookup table, a derived feature-flag set), wire it up with `fastn.envConfig.set` and don't manually pre-create the key — the first run will create it.
- `fetch(url, opts)` and `console.log/warn/error` exist. console output is captured in execution logs. `fetch` has a 30s timeout and returns `{ ok, status, statusText, text(), json(), data }` — not a full WHATWG Response. It is a LAST RESORT: it bypasses connector auth, rate limiting, and observability; prefer a connector action whenever one exists.

### Sub-flows — call a flow from a flow (`fastn.flow`)
- `await fastn.flow.invoke(slug, input, opts?)` — **synchronous**: runs the child in-process and returns its return value inline. Use to compose/reuse another flow when you need its result.
- `await fastn.flow.invokeAsync(slug, input, opts?)` — **fire-and-forget**: starts the child as its own execution, returns `{ executionId }` immediately, parent does NOT wait. Use to kick off independent work.
- `input` becomes the child's `ctx.input`. `opts.headers` merges over the parent's `ctx.headers` (caller wins); auth/identity headers are always stripped — you cannot pass credentials into a child. The child inherits the parent's tenant binding and `mockMode`/`mockScenarios`, so sub-flows are mocked in test runs too. Resolve `slug` via `list_workflows`.

**Guards (throw `UserCodeError` — design around them):**
- **Depth** ≤ 5 nested sub-flows (both forms).
- **`invoke` tier rule:** may only invoke a child whose tier ≤ its own (`instant < standard < long`) — the child runs inline in the caller's time budget. To call a higher-tier child, use `invokeAsync` (no tier gate).
- **`invoke` cycle detection:** re-entering a flow already in the call chain throws (`a -> b -> a`). `invokeAsync` has NO cycle detection (the child is a fresh execution) — avoid self-referential async loops yourself.

`invokeAsync` children count against the execution quota and are durable for standard/long (best-effort in-process for instant).

### Calling Redis and DB connectors from workflows
Redis and DB connectors work like any other connector:
```js
// Redis connector — call any of its actions
const result = await fastn.connector.redis.setValue({ key: "user:123", value: JSON.stringify(data), ttl: 3600 });
const cached = await fastn.connector.redis.getValue({ key: "user:123" });

// DB connector — parameterized SQL query
const rows = await fastn.connector.db.query({ sql: "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?", params: ["cust_123"] });
// rows.output.rows = [{id: 1, ...}, ...]

// For INTERNAL caching (platform Redis, fast, no connector overhead):
const cached = await fastn.cache.get("price:ITEM-123", { scope: "PROJECT" });
if (!cached) {
  const price = await fastn.connector.d365.getPrice({ sku: "ITEM-123" });
  await fastn.cache.set("price:ITEM-123", price.output, { ttl: 86400, scope: "PROJECT" });
}
```
Key distinction: `fastn.cache` = platform Redis (sub-ms, for caching). `fastn.connector.redis.*` = user's external Redis (their own data). `fastn.db` = workspace Postgres (managed). `fastn.connector.db.*` = user's external database.

## WHAT DOES NOT WORK
Calling any of these fails parse or throws at runtime:
- **Timers:** `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate`. There is NO sleep mechanism — `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, x))` throws too. Do not write retry-with-backoff sleeps.
- **`require()` / `import`** (static or dynamic) — stripped at parse.
- **Node built-ins:** `fs`, `crypto`, `http`, `Buffer`, `process` (so no `crypto.randomUUID()`, no `Buffer.from()`, no `process.env`).
- **Browser APIs:** `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, `URL`, `URLSearchParams`, `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`.

## EXECUTION TIERS AND TIMEOUTS
The tier selects the execution ROUTE, not the time limit:
- `instant` — `execute_workflow` runs synchronously and returns the result. Single-record / event-handler logic. (good for flow that take upto 60s)
- `standard` — queues on Temporal, returns 202 + executionId. Loops, pagination, multi-call flows. (good for flow that take upto 15min)
- `long` — same queueing, separate queue. Historical imports, thousands of records.(good for flow that take upto 6h)

Wall-clock is governed by the workflow's `timeoutMs` (default 120s / 2min, max 6h) — the tier does NOT raise it. A standard-tier sync whose loop runs longer than 2 minutes WILL time out unless you set `timeoutMs` on `create_workflow`. Any loop over records is never instant; when in doubt, choose standard and size `timeoutMs` to the realistic worst case.

`test_workflow` always runs the sandbox synchronously regardless of tier — for workflows whose bounded test still takes minutes, prefer `execute_workflow` + `get_execution` polling.

## MANUAL / DIRECT API EXECUTION
A saved workflow is callable over HTTP at `POST {orgId}/api/v1/workflows/{idOrSlug}/execute` (`execute_workflow` wraps this):
- Body `{ "input": { ... } }` becomes `ctx.input` verbatim (defaults to `{}` when omitted); request headers become `ctx.headers` (auth/gateway headers stripped). `input` carries SCOPE only.
- `?env=` query param selects which code runs: omitted or `test` runs the latest published / dev code; a named env (`live`, `qa`, …) runs that environment's active deployment, 404 if none.
- `Idempotency-Key` header dedupes — a repeated key returns the original execution instead of running again.
- Instant tier responds synchronously with `{ data: <return value> }` plus `X-Execution-*` headers; standard / long respond `202 { data: { executionId, status: "queued" } }` — poll `get_execution` for the result.
- Multi-tenant form `POST {ownerOrgId}/api/v1/{resourceOrgId}/workflows/{idOrSlug}/execute` runs the owner's workflow against another org's connections; the `x-fastn-user-id` header scopes to a specific end-user's connection.
- Failures return structured fields (`errorCategory`, `fixSuggestion`) and a non-2xx status; a thrown user-code error surfaces as 422, a timeout as 408.
