# GATE — confirm the test cases for EVERY build, BEFORE building

> Read this before BUILD for **every** workflow you build — a data-movement sync (after MAP: mappings approved, config saved) OR a single-system automation (as soon as you understand the request, or right after its scoped MAP if it carried business rules; cases come from the workflow's own logic — see **SINGLE-SYSTEM AUTOMATIONS** below). **The GATE is per-workflow, never conditional on a config existing, and its cases are ALWAYS user-approved via `submit_test_cases` before you build — you never author-and-self-validate.** Then come back to **THE SUITE IS A REGRESSION GATE** (bottom) every time you MODIFY an existing flow, config, or connector action.
>
> **The purpose is to PROVE the workflow actually works — not to hit a number.** Every case exists to catch a real way the integration can be broken: a field the target rejects, a value that silently dropped, a filter that skips the wrong records, a re-sync that duplicates. The counts and bands below are just a means to that end — they scale coverage so fewer bugs have somewhere to hide. A big suite that passes while nothing synced proves nothing; a case only counts if its `pass` names a verifiable end state the run must reach (see line "A `pass` condition must be an OUTCOME"). Coverage without real outcome-assertions is theater.
>
> Goal: agree on what "working" means for the WHOLE integration — a **comprehensive** set of acceptance scenarios that exercise every branch of every flow — get ONE approval, then build. Write each in business language and group it by scenario for the review UI, but be granular: one case per mapping, transform, condition, and code path — NOT a handful of high-level "it syncs" cases. Coverage is the point; a thin set is exactly why bugs slip through.

## Generate them in this structured shape
Produce ONE object for the whole integration — **this object is the payload you pass to `submit_test_cases`** (below):
- `scope` — one-line integration scope.
- `testCases[]` — each: `id` (`TC-01`, `TC-02`, …), `group` (e.g. `happy-path`, `filters`, `edge-cases`, `custom-fields`), `scenario` (what is exercised), `pass` (the **exact, verifiable** condition that means it passes), `mode` (`live` | `mock`), plus the **executable fixture**: `input` (JSON text for `ctx.input`), `headers` (JSON text for simulated `ctx.headers`, e.g. `{"x-end-org-id":"..."}`), and `mockScenarios` (per-action scenario overrides, for `mock` cases). The fixture is what makes a case REPLAYABLE — any agent re-runs it verbatim via `test_workflow { input, headers, mockMode, mockScenarios }` instead of re-deriving the setup from the scenario prose. Author it for every case; a case without a fixture cannot serve as a regression gate.
- `groups[]` (optional) — `{ name, description }`, names matching `testCases[].group`.

**Three case classes are ALWAYS in the set** (in addition to the coverage matrix below):
- **Data parity** (any flow that moves data): a live case whose `pass` IS the parity audit — eligible-count reconciliation (eligible = created + updated + explained skips, zero unexplained residue, target count matches) plus a field-by-field sample: source record → approved mapping → expected payload vs the record read back from the target, field-exact. Procedure and `run_code` skeleton: workflow-verifier `references/verify-matrix.md` §1b.
- **Config-liveness** (any flow reading a `configId`): edit a marker value in the config → re-run → the run reflects the CURRENT config. This is the case that catches the "I changed the config but the sync ignores it" bug (stale/hardcoded configId).
- **Trigger-fire** (any flow with a bound trigger): the bound trigger, fired for real (scheduler run-now / synthetic app event shaped exactly like the `payloadSchema` / POST to the webhook `triggerUrl`), produces a completed execution — verified by correlating the fire's `eventId` against `list_executions` (PHASE 4 / workflow-verifier verify-matrix has the loop). A workflow whose trigger has never produced an execution is not verified, whatever the sandbox suite says.

## How many cases — DERIVE the count from the config, never pick a round number
There is **no upper limit** and **no target like "about 20"** — the count is a *function of the workflow's surface area*, so read the saved config and ENUMERATE. Walk each item below and emit every case it produces; a real multi-entity or two-way sync yields **many dozens**, not ~20. If your set is small, you undercounted — go back through the list.

Per **entity pair × direction**, generate cases for:
- **Happy path — create AND update as SEPARATE cases** (target-absent → create; target-exists → update). Never fold them into one.
- **Every mapping field** — at minimum one case per REQUIRED target field proving it lands with the right value; group optional fields but cover any that are non-trivial. A mapped field the target rejects is the #1 silent bug, so each required field earns a case.
- **Every transform** in the config — one case each: `combine`, `conditional` (both branches = 2 cases), `fallback` (present + absent = 2), `split`, `value mapping` (a mapped value + an unmapped pass-through = 2), `fixed value`.
- **Every condition/filter** — one PASS case (record meets it → synced) and one SKIP case (record fails it → `skipped`, assert the reason) per condition, per operator used.
- **Every custom property / `createIfMissing`** — a case that the property exists and is writable.
- **Match / upsert logic** — found-by-id (update via `id_map`), found-by-natural-key (search → update + map), not-found (→ create), and stale-mapping self-heal (cached id 404/410 → re-search → repair).
- **Cursor / delta** — first run (no cursor → full scan) and a delta run (`modifiedSince` → only changed records); assert a manual/test run does NOT advance the cursor.
- **Idempotency** — re-running an unchanged record produces `skipped` with NO target write (proves the content-hash cache).
- **Pagination** — a multi-page scan and an empty page.
- **Edge / failure** — missing required source field, null/empty optional fields, malformed record, duplicate/existing match, deletion (if handled), rate-limit/retry (`mockScenarios`), not-found from the target.
- **Two-way only** — a conflict case per direction (latest-write-wins) and a loop-guard case (a write echoed back does not re-sync).

**Self-check before submitting:** for each flow, confirm you have ≥1 case per mapping-required-field, per transform branch, per condition, plus create + update + skip + idempotency. Missing any of those = incomplete set, don't submit yet. Completeness over brevity — never trim for the review UI's sake. Every case ends up **bound to its flow(s)** via `create_workflow`'s `testCases`, and BUILD runs and asserts EVERY one (step 6).

## A `pass` condition must be an OUTCOME, not "it ran"
The gate only catches bugs if `pass` names a **verifiable end state** the run must reach. "Returns 2xx", "no exception", "workflow completes" are NOT pass conditions — they stay true when every record failed or nothing synced (the exact way these tests fail silently today). Write each `pass` so it can only be true if the sync actually did its job:
- **Assert the return counts.** Sync workflows return `{ created, updated, skipped, errors, errorDetails }`. A happy-path `pass` must require `errors === 0` **AND** the expected outcome moved (`created ≥ 1` or `updated ≥ 1` for the seeded record) — never merely that the call returned. `errors > 0`, or `created === 0 && updated === 0` on a happy path, is a **FAIL**, even at HTTP 200.
- **For a live write, assert the TARGET — not the summary.** The `pass` reads the record BACK from the target by id / natural key and checks the mapped fields hold the expected values. `created: 1` is the workflow's own claim; the record existing in the target with the right fields is the proof.
- **Name the exact field values a mapping could get wrong.** e.g. "HubSpot deal `amount` = 240.00 and `dealstage` = 'closedwon'" — not "a deal is created". A vague pass hides mapping bugs: wrong field, a field the target rejects, a dropped/blank value.
- **For skip/error cases, assert the REASON.** "skipped = 1 with reason 'condition not met'" or "errors = 1 with errorMessage containing 'not found'" — so a skip you EXPECT is provably distinct from a silent all-skip you don't.

## CASE POWER — a suite is only as strong as the bugs it can catch

Coverage counts measure breadth; POWER measures whether a plausible bug actually flips a case. A suite authored from the same understanding that will write the code shares the code's blind spots — these two checks break that, and both run BEFORE `submit_test_cases`:

**1. Trace every requirement — both directions.** Each case cites what it verifies: a mapping id, a condition, or the user's own phrase from the request ("only products in category X" → the case quotes it). Then check both directions: a requirement with no case is a coverage gap (add the case); at build time, code behavior with no requirement is unintended behavior (INTENT CONFORMANCE in the workflow-verifier catches it — but the trace is what makes that diff possible).

**2. Kill matrix — for every defect class, name the case that would FAIL if the defect existed.** These classes are from real production incidents; a suite where no attached case kills a class that applies to this build is underpowered — add the killing case:

| Defect class (how it shipped) | The killing case |
|---|---|
| Wrong/swapped field mapping | Field-exact read-back asserting the exact VALUE per required field ("amount = 240.00"), not "a record exists" |
| Silently dropped write linkage — 200 but the relation never created (e.g. a note created WITHOUT its deal association) | A case whose `pass` asserts the RELATION on target read-back, not just the record |
| Unmapped enum/value passthrough — provider 400s or silently defaults | A case sending a source value OUTSIDE the mapped set; `pass` names the expected translation or the expected explained skip |
| Filter inverted / too broad | The PASS + SKIP pair per condition, each asserting counts AND the skip reason |
| Pagination stops at page 1 | A case whose source spans >1 page, `pass` asserts the TOTAL count |
| Update path re-creates instead of updating | The idempotency + update pair: re-run → `skipped`, edit → `updated: 1` and target search by key returns exactly ONE record |
| Missing `await` — "[object Promise]" flows downstream | Any case asserting field VALUES kills it (a stringified Promise never equals the expected value) — which is why value assertions are mandatory |
| Payload wrapper shape — handler reads `.data`/`.payload`/`.event` that production events don't have | The trigger-fire case with a payloadSchema-shaped event (the schema IS ctx.input) |
| Stale config read — flow ignores widget edits | The config-liveness case (marker edit → re-run reflects it) |

Self-check output: for each applicable class, the killing case's id; for inapplicable ones, why (surface absent). A class with no killer and no reason = do not submit yet.

**Scale the count to the scope — the number is an OUTPUT of the coverage matrix below, never a figure to trim to.** Run every scenario class against every entity flow/direction and let the count fall out. Rough bands:

| Scope | Shape | Target band |
|---|---|---|
| **Small** | single entity, one-way | ~15–25 |
| **Medium** | 2 entities, or bidirectional, or one reshape | ~40–70 |
| **Large** | 3+ entity flows, multiple connectors, reshapes, or tracking/enrichment flows | **~90–130** |

If a **large**-scope run comes back with only ~30 cases, the matrix wasn't fully applied — go back and fill the empty cells before submitting. A large integration with a small test set is a red flag, not a shortcut.

## Scale coverage to scope — the per-flow scenario matrix
For EACH entity flow (source→target pair, per direction), generate **at least one case for every scenario class below that applies to it**. This is the mechanical generator that makes coverage complete AND makes the count scale with scope: ~16 scenario classes × N flows — each class fanned out per operator/branch/field it touches — is how a large integration reaches 90–130 cases. Skip a cell only when it genuinely cannot occur for that flow — and say so; never skip to save space.

| # | Scenario class | Applies | Mode | Assert |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Happy-path first create | every flow | **live** | record created in target with mapped fields; read it back |
| 2 | Update via `id_map` (re-sync) | every flow | mock | matched record UPDATED; no duplicate |
| 3 | Dedup — exists in target, NOT in `id_map` | every flow | mock | matched by natural key → **UPDATE, not a new record** (the classic sync-breaker) |
| 4 | Content-hash unchanged | every flow | mock | skipped with **NO target call** (2nd run must be cheaper) |
| 5 | Each business filter / scope | one per filter | mock | excluded + counted (empty-required, status, test/demo, archived, date-range…) |
| 6 | Empty required field at source | every flow | mock | handled per the chosen policy — skip+count, OR default/derived value applied — never a silent unhandled drop or a 400 |
| 7 | Skip-on-error (one bad record) | every flow | mock | caught → pushed to `errorDetails`, loop continues |
| 8 | Return-shape counts | ≥1 overall | mock | run returns `{ created, updated, skipped, errors, errorDetails }` |
| 9 | Self-heal stale mapping (404/410 on update) | every flow | mock | re-search by natural key → repair mapping / create fresh |
| 10 | Rate-limit / 429 | ≥1 per connector | mock (`mockScenarios`) | degrades gracefully, no unhandled throw (sandbox has no sleep/backoff) |
| 11 | Pagination (multi-page source) | every flow | mock | all pages fetched; processed count = total across pages |
| 12 | Delta cursor run | every flow | mock | only changed records processed; cursor advances ONLY on a real scheduled run, not manual/test |
| 13 | First run (no cursor) = full backfill | every flow | mock | unbounded scan processes the whole set |
| 14 | Reshape / aggregation fidelity | per reshape | mock | **field-level** assertion (SKU / qty / unit price / bucket), NOT just array length |
| 15 | Custom-property / transform | per property | **live** | value written AND persists on read-back |
| 16 | Cross-entity dependency not-yet-synced | child flows | mock | defer/skip gracefully + log; never write an invalid parent/foreign id |
| 17 | Deletion / archival | every flow | mock | explicit handling — or a documented no-op for one-way create/update |
| 18 | Two-way conflict (latest-write-wins) | bidirectional only | mock | correct winner chosen; no ping-pong loop |

**How the matrix produces the count.** Multiply applicable classes by flows:
- **A full record-sync flow** (create + update) — most classes apply (create, update, dedup, content-hash, each of its filters, missing-required, skip-on-error, self-heal, rate-limit, pagination, cursor, backfill, cross-entity, deletion; plus reshape fidelity if it reshapes), each fanned out per field / operator / branch it touches → **~30–40 cases**.
- **An update-only / enrichment flow** (writes fields onto an already-synced record) — a narrower slice applies (happy-path, its filters, missing-required, skip-on-error, rate-limit, pagination, cursor, custom-property, cross-entity) → **~18–22 cases**.

A three-flow integration therefore lands around **90–120 cases**, not a few dozen; fewer flows shrink it toward the Medium/Small bands the same way. **The matrix sets the count — not a target number.** Every class-1 happy-path and class-15 custom-property stays `live`; the rest `mock`.

**`mode` — live vs mock. YOU assign it — NEVER ask the user.** Live-vs-mock is a technical decision, not a business one: never surface it as a question ("production or sandbox?", "live or mock?") at any point — not when generating the cases, not at review, not before running them. Testing is **live by default, without asking** — but be smart about the split: keep the live set to the MINIMUM the matrix requires (the class-1 happy-path anchors and class-15 custom-property cases, smallest input, cleaned up after) and run everything else in mock, so the suite never hammers the real APIs (rate limits, quota burn, test-data noise in the target). The only exception is an EXPLICIT user instruction: if the user asks to test in mock only, flip the live cases to mock, run it, and note that the real-write boundary is unproven until a live anchor runs. Mock proves the workflow's LOGIC against stubs you authored — it does NOT prove the stubs are right or that a real record lands in the target. Split by what each can actually prove:
- **At least one `live` happy-path per entity pair + direction** — the real end-to-end write (create the record in the real target with the mapped fields; read it back to confirm). This is the sync's "main work" and mock cannot simulate it — never leave the core happy-path mock-only. Also use `live` where the real-API contract IS the thing under test: auth, the target accepting the payload, chained/dependent calls, a custom property actually created and writable. Keep each `live` case to the SMALLEST input and clean up what it writes (per REAL-EXECUTION SAFETY in `references/workflow-patterns.md`).
  - **You must PRODUCE the source trigger for the live test — don't assume it exists or wait for it.** For a polling/list source, create or pick one real source record. For an **event-driven source** (message broker or webhook), the topic/queue may be empty and the connection is NOT necessarily listen-only — generate a **synthetic event** (dedicated test consumer + catch-all rule, then publish; or POST the sample webhook payload) matching the event's `payloadSchema`. See "LIVE-TESTING an event flow" in `references/workflow-patterns.md`.
- **`mock` for everything else** (the default, no connector credits, deterministic) — the breadth of logic mock can definitively prove: field mappings, transforms, null-safety, conditions/filters, skip/error paths, and forced-failure scenarios via `mockScenarios` (not found / rate limited).

**Mock is BLIND to the real-API boundary — that's why a live anchor is mandatory, not optional.** A stub serves whatever it was authored to return, so a mock run cannot see: the target rejecting the payload, a mapped field the target doesn't have (an "X is invalid" create error), a value that silently dropped, or a real record actually landing. A flow that passes every mock case can still fail the real write — so **every write path needs a live case that reads the target back.** Conversely, a mock run is NOT automatically a pass: if its result carries `errors > 0` or a `mock failed: Missing required input fields …` message, the workflow called an action with a bad/missing arg — a genuine bug the mock surfaced. Fix it; never score it as pass.

## SINGLE-SYSTEM AUTOMATIONS — derive cases from the AUTOMATION'S logic, not the sync matrix
The matrix above (entity pairs, directions, `id_map`, cursors, dedup) is for data-movement syncs. A single-system automation — "apply a discount when an order is placed", "tag a ticket when it's escalated", "post to Slack on a new signup" — has **no cross-system source→target mapping**, so you derive its cases from the WORKFLOW'S OWN LOGIC rather than the sync matrix. Two sub-cases, per the ROUTER's Q2 in the main SKILL.md:

- **Rules-bearing automation (ran a SCOPED MAP → has a `configId`).** The editable rule lives in the config — a filter (`in` / `not_in`) plus a chosen fixed value the user set at `reviewUrl`. **Derive cases from that config's conditions and selected value AS WELL AS the workflow's own logic:** one case per condition pass/skip, one asserting the chosen value is what actually gets written, plus the trigger / branch / action-contract / idempotency / edge cases below. Editing the rule in the widget must change behavior with no code change — so at least one case should exercise the value the config currently holds.
- **Rule-free automation (no config).** A fixed notification, a parameterless job, a passthrough webhook — nothing editable, so there is no config and you derive cases purely from the WORKFLOW'S OWN LOGIC.

Either way, enumerate:
- **Trigger — fires vs does-NOT-fire.** One case where the triggering condition is met (the automation runs) and one where it is not (the automation is a no-op / skips). e.g. BOGO: an order WITH 2 qualifying items → discount applied; an order WITHOUT them → no change.
- **Every business-rule branch.** One case per branch of the rule, including the threshold boundary (exactly at the limit, just below, just above) and combinations if the rule composes. e.g. 2 items vs 1 item vs 4 items; multiple different qualifying SKUs in one order.
- **The REAL action contract — at least one `live` case per write action, read the target back.** This is the class of bug the mock is blind to and that broke the Shopify BOGO build (`createOrderRefundsJson` rejecting `Kind suggested_refund is not a valid transaction`): the real API rejecting the payload, a field it doesn't accept, a value it silently coerces. The `pass` must assert the write actually took effect in the source system on read-back (the discount/line-item/refund is really on the order), not that the call returned 2xx.
- **Idempotency / re-fire.** The same trigger firing twice on the same record must not double-apply (two discounts, two refunds). Assert the second run is a no-op or safely re-converges.
- **Edge / failure.** Missing/empty fields on the triggering record, the action's not-found / rate-limit path (`mockScenarios`), a partially-qualifying record.
- **Business-rule AMBIGUITIES become explicit review cases — this is the whole point of surfacing the set.** Where the request is under-specified, encode your interpretation AS a case with a `pass` the user can confirm or correct in the review page, e.g. "BOGO is applied as a **money refund of one item's price** (not an added free line item), and the item **stays fulfilled**" — so the user catches a wrong reading (refund vs. free line item; keep vs. cancel fulfillment) BEFORE it writes real records, instead of after. Never resolve such an ambiguity silently and skip review.

Count for a single-system automation is small (roughly the Small band, ~10–20), but the GATE and the `submit_test_cases` approval are **mandatory all the same** — a single-connector build is not exempt.

## Submit for review and approval — `submit_test_cases`
Call **`submit_test_cases`** with the structured set above. It stores the set and returns a **`reviewUrl`** (plus a reference id) — a hosted page where the user reviews the cases grouped by `group`, **edits / adds / removes** any case, and **approves in the browser**. You do NOT hand-render this UI — the tool hosts it (the same model as `propose_configuration` → `reviewUrl` for the mappings).
- **Share the `reviewUrl`** with the user.
- **Poll for approval** using the returned reference (the same way you poll `check_config_status` for the config); stop after ~5 minutes of no response and check in.
- On approval the tool returns the **confirmed set**, which may differ from what you submitted because the user edited it there. **NEVER fabricate the approval** — it only comes back from the tool.

## After approval — CHECK the approved set, then build on top of it
- The user's edits in the review page are the source of truth — **build from the APPROVED set the tool returned, never from your originally-submitted version.**
- The **test-case approval is the FINAL go-ahead to build** (not the mapping approval). After it, proceed into PHASE 3 — BUILD autonomously; do not re-ask "shall I build?"
- **Attach the APPROVED cases at `create_workflow` — the tool REQUIRES them.** `testCases` is a required field on every `create_workflow` and `update_workflow` call (a call without it is rejected); `test_workflow` does NOT take them. Pass each flow the approved cases relevant to it, as exactly `{ id, group, scenario, pass, mode, input, headers, mockScenarios }` — keep the executable fixture on every case; they appear in the dashboard's validation panel. (`scope` / `groups` are for the review page only; just the per-case array attaches.) On later updates, pass the current set from `get_workflow` when unchanged.
- These cases are the **acceptance criteria**: BUILD must run each one in its `mode` and assert its `pass` condition before the flow is done (BUILD ORDER step 6 in `references/build.md`).
- **Persist every run with `save_validation` — evidence included, failures included.** Payload: `{ status: pass|partial|fail, mode: live|mock, results: [{ id, status: pass|fail|skipped|partial, evidence, error?, fix? }], cleanup? }` — `evidence` carries what proves the case (execution id, returned counts, target read-back values), `error`/`fix` what broke and what you did. Record failing runs too: `lastValidation` still showing an old green run while the current code fails is worse than a red panel. After saving, the dashboard's validation panel reflects the run; a `lastValidation` older than the latest code change means the deployed code has never been validated.

## THE SUITE IS A REGRESSION GATE — re-run it after EVERY change, for the life of the flow

The approved cases are not a one-time build checklist — they are the flow's **permanent acceptance contract**, and incremental changes are where working integrations break: an edit that quietly turns a read-only flow into a live writer, a rewrite that changes an error message a case asserts on, a config repoint the flows never picked up. Every one of those ships silently unless the suite is re-run. Attaching cases and never executing them (`lastValidation: null`) is the same as having no tests.

- **ANY change re-arms the gate.** After `update_workflow`, `edit_workflow_code`, `create_workflow` on an existing slug, repointing a flow to a new `configId`, an approved config edit, or a change to a connector action the flow calls — **re-run the FULL attached suite for every affected flow** and assert each `pass` condition again, exactly as in BUILD step 6, then persist with `save_validation`. Not just the case that covers what you changed: a regression run exists to catch what you did **NOT** intend to change. A shared change (config, connector action, env-config) affects EVERY flow that reads it — re-run each one's suite, not only the flow you were asked to touch.
- **"Edited and published" is NOT "done."** The change is complete only when the suite re-passes on the returned values — and live cases on target read-back — for the NEW version. Never claim success for a modification whose suite hasn't re-run; `lastValidation` still showing the pre-edit run (or `null`) means the new code has never been validated.
- **A `run_code` simulation of the logic is NOT a regression run.** Re-run the deployed flow itself (`test_workflow`). For any change touching a write path, a mapping, or the config, include the live case(s) and READ THE TARGET RECORD BACK — value coercion by the target (an unknown choice value silently defaulting), a dropped field, or a fixed-value/`__fixed:` mapping the code never decodes only show up there.
- **Keep the suite in SYNC with the change.** An edit can silently stale cases — changed error text, renamed fields, a writer converted to read-only — so walk the attached set, update every case the change invalidated, and ADD cases for the new behavior (derived the same way as the original set: per new mapping, transform branch, condition). A stale case that would fail if run is a regression already shipped. If the change alters WHAT the integration does (new entity/direction, changed acceptance semantics) — not just how — resubmit the updated set via `submit_test_cases` for approval; for internal fixes, updating the attached cases via `update_workflow` suffices.
- **A NEW flow added mid-integration gets cases FIRST.** Never `create_workflow` with `testCases: null` because the gate "already happened" — derive its cases, attach them, and run them like any other flow's.
- **When the user reports a breakage, the suite is your audit tool — believe the evidence.** "It worked before your change" means a regression until proven otherwise: re-run the suite on the current version, read back what's actually deployed (`get_workflow` — is the code/`configId` what you claimed?), and inventory shared artifacts (which config do the flows read vs which one the widget edits?) BEFORE re-asserting that it's fixed. Repeating the success claim without a fresh passing run is how one bug costs six rounds of user evidence.
