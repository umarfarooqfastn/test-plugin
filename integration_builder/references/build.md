# PHASE 3 — BUILD

> Read this when you are in the BUILD phase. Goal: build the workflows that realize the plan, test them safely against live connectors, bind triggers, and finish with an embed **widget**. Sync workflows read the approved config (the `configId` from MAP) at runtime — the DYNAMIC CONFIG principle in `references/dynamic-config.md` (read it with this file; it also covers ENV-CONFIG and the EnrichSpec/`paramDeps` dropdown shape) — so the user can edit mappings/filters later with no code change. Technical depth lives in `references/sandbox.md` (the `fastn.*` contract) and `references/workflow-patterns.md` (design rules, safety, triggers).

Every saved workflow is an HTTP API endpoint by default (`POST .../workflows/{idOrSlug}/execute`); triggers (schedule, webhook, app-event) are just additional ways to invoke that same endpoint, never a prerequisite for calling it.

## FROM PLAN TO WORKFLOWS (syncs arriving from PHASE 2)
Map the approved config to concrete builds. Every workflow here reads the SAME single `configId` (each picks its flow from the config by source/target entity):
- **One-way** → ONE sync workflow (source → target).
- **Two-way** → ONE workflow PER DIRECTION, each maintaining the external-ID mapping for its direction; latest-write-wins on conflict.
- **Initial load** → folded into the schedule flow's FIRST run (no cursor yet → full scan); split it into a SEPARATE `long`-tier backfill workflow ONLY when that first full run won't fit one scheduled run's `timeoutMs` (very large catalogs).
- **Ongoing** → per entity pair + direction, build a **schedule flow** (cursored batch — full on first run, delta after via `modifiedSince`; also the reconcile/safety net) PLUS an **event flow** (single-record latency). Separate workflows per the one-execution-shape rule; the schedule flow advances its cursor only on production runs, never on manual/test runs. See SYNC TOPOLOGY in `references/workflow-patterns.md`.
- **"Both"** → the schedule flow already covers it (first run loads history, then deltas); pre-run a separate backfill only when you split one out for volume.

**Custom target properties:** if MAP created any (Create custom property / `createIfMissing`), ensure each exists in the target BEFORE the first sync — call the target connector's create-property action idempotently (probe it like any other write, BUILD ORDER step 4). If the connector has no create-property action, add it per the PREREQUISITES gate (connector-builder) first.

**Build the whole set autonomously — do not ask which to build first.** The plan above fully determines the workflows and their order; you decide it, you don't consult the user. Default order: **backfill → ongoing (event + reconcile)**. Build, probe, test, and trigger each flow in turn, moving straight to the next — never stop after one flow to ask "should I continue?" The only pauses are the live-safety ones (a test writing more than a couple of live records, or arming a schedule). When every flow plus the widget is done, report the whole result once.

**Field-pair** mappings apply with `fastn.evaluator` (`applyMappings` / `evaluateConditions` / `applyDefaults`). **Transform** mappings are a reshape the evaluator cannot perform — it maps fields, it does not aggregate/bucket/combine — so implement the reshape in workflow code, but keep its PARAMETERS in the saved config and read them via `fastn.config.get` so they stay editable without a code change.

### Filter conditions → JS checks in workflow code
`conditions` is an array directly on the flow (`dir.conditions`), not `conditions.suggestedConditions`:
```js
const config = await fastn.config.get(CONFIG_ID);
const flows = config.entities ?? config.directions ?? [];
const dir = flows.find(d =>
  (d.source?.entity ?? d.sourceEntity) === SOURCE_ENTITY &&
  (d.target?.entity ?? d.targetEntity) === TARGET_ENTITY);
for (const record of records) {
  const result = fastn.evaluator.evaluateConditions(record, dir.conditions);
  if (!result.pass) { skipped++; continue; }
  // ... process record
}
```
Operators: equals (`===`), not_equals (`!==`), contains (`String(x).includes(v)`), not_contains, greater_than (`Number(x) > Number(v)`), less_than, is_empty (`!x`), is_not_empty (`!!x`), in (`[...].includes(x)`), not_in, matches (regex).

### Field transforms from the accepted config
Read advanced transforms from the config and implement as plain JS — NEVER call an LLM at runtime for mapping. This includes the **empty-required-field policy** chosen at MAP (skip / derived placeholder / fixed default — `references/mapping.md`): it arrives as a condition or a conditional/combine/fixed transform; implement it exactly as saved, and when the derived value feeds a natural key, reuse that same computed value for matching (DERIVED natural keys in `references/workflow-patterns.md`):

| Transform | Config shape | JS implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **combine** | `{ type: "combine", fields: [{field}], separator }` | `fields.map(f => record[f.field]).filter(Boolean).join(separator)` |
| **conditional** | `{ type: "conditional", when: {field,op,value}, thenField, elseField }` | `if/else` based on operator |
| **fallback** | `{ type: "fallback", fallbackField }` | `record[source] \|\| record[fallback]` |
| **split** | `{ type: "split", separator, index }` | `String(val).split(sep)[index]` |
| **ai** | `{ type: "ai", prompt }` | Write equivalent static JS. NEVER call an LLM at runtime for mapping. |
| **fixed value** | `valueMappings` with empty sourceField | `targetValue` constant |
| **value mapping** | `valueMappings: [{sourceValue, targetValue}, ...]` | Lookup object: `map[record[source]] ?? record[source]` |

### Building the mapping function
```js
function applyMappings(sourceRecord, mappings) {
  const target = {};
  for (const m of mappings) {
    if (m.condition?.type === "combine") {
      target[m.targetField] = m.condition.fields.map(f => sourceRecord[f.field]).filter(Boolean).join(m.condition.separator || " ");
    } else if (m.condition?.type === "conditional") {
      const { when, thenField, elseField } = m.condition;
      const passes = when.operator === "equals" ? sourceRecord[when.field] === when.value
        : when.operator === "is_empty" ? !sourceRecord[when.field]
        : when.operator === "is_not_empty" ? !!sourceRecord[when.field]
        : when.operator === "contains" ? String(sourceRecord[when.field] || "").includes(when.value)
        : true;
      target[m.targetField] = passes ? sourceRecord[thenField] : sourceRecord[elseField];
    } else if (m.condition?.type === "fallback") {
      target[m.targetField] = sourceRecord[m.sourceField] || sourceRecord[m.condition.fallbackField];
    } else if (m.valueMappings?.length && !m.sourceField) {
      target[m.targetField] = m.valueMappings[0].targetValue;
    } else if (m.valueMappings?.length) {
      const map = Object.fromEntries(m.valueMappings.map(vm => [vm.sourceValue, vm.targetValue]));
      target[m.targetField] = map[sourceRecord[m.sourceField]] ?? sourceRecord[m.sourceField];
    } else {
      target[m.targetField] = sourceRecord[m.sourceField];
    }
  }
  return target;
}
```

## BUILD ORDER — never skip steps
1. **`list_connectors` → `get_connector_methods` → `get_action_schema`** — discover what exists. Note each connector's scope (community vs custom) — it changes how workflow code must call it. (Coming from PHASE 1/2 you already have this — do not repeat the calls.)
2. **`list_state_keys` + `list_tables`** — see what is taken. ALWAYS create fresh, workflow-scoped names; NEVER read or write an existing state key or db table unless the user explicitly told you to use that one.
3. **Confirm any env-config keys the workflow will READ are already provisioned.** For every key the workflow code calls via `await fastn.envConfig.get(key)`, run `list_env_configs()` and check the value exists for every env_slug the workflow runs in. **You do NOT create env-configs from this skill at BUILD time** — the operator provisions them via the dashboard's Configurations tab. If a key the workflow READS is missing, STOP and surface the gap: name the key, the env_slug, and the workflow you were about to build. Do not call `bulk_upsert_env_configs` / `create_environment` / `upsert_env_config` from this skill, and never write a placeholder value to "unblock" the build. **Exception — write-only keys:** if the workflow's purpose is to POPULATE an env-config via `fastn.envConfig.set(key, value)` (it never reads `.get` for that key first; the first run creates the row), the key does NOT need to exist beforehand — `set` upserts. Don't gate the build on the row's pre-existence for those keys.
4. **PROBE writes with `run_code`** — exercise EVERY connector action the workflow will call, reads AND writes, before `create_workflow`. **Read `get_action_schema` for each action BEFORE its first probe/execute** — learn the exact param names, types, and required set and pass matching args, so the call doesn't fail on a terse gateway error (a bare timeout, `Missing required input fields`, or a silent service-root fallback) that costs a debug round-trip. Schemas lie; only a real 2xx with the expected shape proves a call works. Un-probed code is not shippable. Probe reads with `limit: 1-2`. **Probe writes with REAL SOURCE DATA through the REAL MAPPING — never hand-invented values.** In the same `run_code`: read ONE real record from the source system, apply the approved mappings (the same field pairs / transforms the workflow will use), and write THAT payload to the target. Fabricated values prove nothing — they can pass while real data fails (source values too long for the target field, format/enum mismatches, encodings, locale-formatted numbers/dates, required fields that happen to be empty on real records). Probing with a mapped real record is what proves the two systems' data actually fits — it's a dress rehearsal of the runtime sync, not a synthetic form-fill. Prefix only the record's name/identifier display fields with `fastn-probe-test` so the test record is recognizable for cleanup — do NOT let the prefix replace real mapped values in the fields under test. Delete the record in the same run when a delete action exists (report the orphan ID when it doesn't). A 401/403 or network error = broken connection → resolve per the PREREQUISITES gate before building. (PHASE 2's `probe_connector` covered list/read actions only — write actions still need probing here.)
4½. **TEST-CASE GATE — cases must be USER-APPROVED before `create_workflow`.** No flow reaches step 5 with a self-authored, unapproved set. A data-movement flow already cleared this between MAP and BUILD — carry its approved set forward. A **single-system automation has not** — run the GATE now: derive its cases from the workflow's own logic (trigger fires/no-fire, each business-rule branch, the real action contract with live read-back, idempotency, edge/failure, and any business-rule ambiguity as an explicit reviewable case — see SINGLE-SYSTEM AUTOMATIONS in `references/test-cases.md`), call `submit_test_cases`, share the `reviewUrl`, and poll for approval. Build from the APPROVED set the tool returns — never fabricate the approval, never proceed to step 5 on a set you validated yourself.
5. **`create_workflow`** — saves AND auto-publishes. **First, DON'T CLOBBER AN EXISTING FLOW.** `create_workflow` slugs **UPSERT** — an existing slug silently UPDATES (overwrites) that workflow. Run `list_workflows` and check whether a flow related to this integration already exists (same slug, or a workflow already syncing this entity pair/direction). If one does, **STOP and ASK the user** whether to update it in place, build alongside under a new slug, or leave it untouched — name the workflow(s) you found and what you'd change. NEVER modify or overwrite a pre-existing related workflow without explicit confirmation; assume a fresh, uniquely-slugged workflow unless the user said to reuse a specific one. Only after that check: pass the COMPLETE code body. **Attach this flow's approved test cases — REQUIRED, not optional.** The `testCases` array is a required field on every `create_workflow` AND `update_workflow` call (the tool rejects a call without it), exactly like `inputSchema`/`testInput`/`testHeaders`. Each case is `{ id, group, scenario, pass, mode, input, headers, mockScenarios }` (from the GATE in `references/test-cases.md`) — the `input`/`headers` (JSON text) and `mockScenarios` fields are the case's **executable fixture**, so any agent can replay it verbatim via `test_workflow` instead of re-deriving the setup from prose; author them for every case. They show in the dashboard's validation panel. Only `create_workflow` / `update_workflow` carry `testCases`; `test_workflow` does not — on updates, pass the current set from `get_workflow` when unchanged. **Declare the input contract — REQUIRED, on every create AND update.** `inputSchema`, `testInput`, and `testHeaders` are all REQUIRED fields on every `create_workflow` and `update_workflow` call — the tool rejects a call missing any of them. `inputSchema` is a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) describing `ctx.input`, derived from a representative example payload (`type`/`properties`/`required` for every key). A flow that truly takes no input still declares it: `{"type":"object","properties":{},"required":[]}`. Pass `outputSchema` too when the return shape is known. Give EVERY property a non-empty `description` (recursively — nested object properties and array items too); the tool rejects a contract with an undescribed property. `testInput` / `testHeaders` are JSON text (max 64 KB each): `testInput` is the same example payload the schema was derived from (`"{}"` for a no-input flow); `testHeaders` carries the simulated headers a test needs (e.g. `{"x-end-org-id": "..."}` for multi-tenant flows, `"{}"` when none) — together they make the workflow runnable from the Test panel the moment it's saved. All of these surface in the dashboard's Contract/Test tabs and are returned by `get_workflow` / `list_workflows`. On updates, re-derive `inputSchema` when the change touches how `ctx.input` is read; otherwise read the stored schema via `get_workflow` and pass it back unchanged. **Successful test runs sync the contract automatically**: any `test_workflow` (or scratch run carrying `workflowId`) that succeeds with a non-empty input re-derives `inputSchema` + `inputExample` from that input and saves the input/headers as the workflow's `testInput`/`testHeaders` — structure follows the last input that actually ran, while your property `description`s are preserved by path. So the tested input IS the contract: make the final validation run use the exact payload shape callers will send.
6. **Validate against the signed-off test cases — the RESULT is the oracle, not the status code.** For THIS flow, run EVERY attached case in its `mode` and **assert its exact `pass` condition on the returned value**: `mock` cases via `test_workflow` `mockMode:true` (use `mockScenarios` to force a case's setup, e.g. "not found" / "rate limited"); `live` cases via ONE bounded live run (SMALLEST input — see REAL-EXECUTION SAFETY in `references/workflow-patterns.md`).

   **A 2xx / "it ran" is NEVER a pass.** The workflow catches per-record failures and returns them in `errorDetails` (SKIP-ON-ERROR), so a run that failed or skipped every record still returns HTTP 200. PARSE the returned `{ created, updated, skipped, errors, errorDetails }` and treat each of these as a **FAILURE to fix before the flow is done** — not a passing checkpoint:
   - **`errors > 0`** — any entry in `errorDetails` fails the case. Read its `errorMessage`, fix the cause, re-run. A mock run reporting `mock failed: Missing required input fields: <field>` means the workflow called an action WITHOUT a required arg (e.g. `searchProducts` with no `query`) — a real bug the mock surfaced, not test noise.
   - **`created === 0 && updated === 0` on a happy-path case** — nothing synced; all-skipped is not success. Inspect WHY every record skipped: a stale content-hash from a prior run (clear the flow's `fastn.state` key and re-run), an over-broad condition filtering everything, or match logic skipping real records. A scheduled run would silently no-op the same way, so this must fail the gate.
   - **counts that don't match the case** — a filter case that should skip 1 but skipped all; a create case that reports update (or vice-versa). The numbers must satisfy the `pass` condition exactly, including the expected skip/error REASON.
   - **live: verify the TARGET, not the summary** — after a live create/update, READ the record back from the target by id / natural key and assert the mapped fields hold the expected values. This is the ONLY check that catches a field the target rejects ("X is invalid"), a dropped value, or a wrong mapping — mock is blind to all of these because the stub accepts any payload.

   Fix any failure with `edit_workflow_code` and **re-run ALL of the flow's cases — not just the one that failed** (a fix can regress a case that was passing; see RE-TEST AFTER EVERY CHANGE in `references/workflow-patterns.md`). **The flow is not done until every case passes on the SAME (final) version of the code, on the returned value AND (for live) on read-back — never on a 2xx alone.** Clean up what live runs wrote. Then **persist the results with `save_validation`** — record each case's id + status (pass/fail) so the dashboard validation panel reflects the latest run.

   **Completeness gate — a clean-looking run is not a synced run.** On the bounded live run, reconcile the counts before calling the flow done: every record eligible under the approved filters must actually land in the target (created/updated, spot-checked by read-back), and every skip must be attributable to an approved condition. A "passing" run that skipped most records — or wrote nothing against a non-empty source — is a defect to diagnose (see SKIP IS A DIAGNOSTIC in `references/workflow-patterns.md`), never a pass.

   **Step 6 is NOT build-only — it re-arms on every later modification.** Any `update_workflow` / `edit_workflow_code` / config repoint / connector-action change re-runs the FULL attached suite for every affected flow before you report the change done (THE SUITE IS A REGRESSION GATE in `references/test-cases.md`). After the update call, also **read the workflow back** (`get_workflow`) and confirm the saved code actually contains the intended change — "updated" claims made from the call alone have shipped description-only edits while the user's bug lived on.
7. **Bind trigger(s) — and VERIFY each one fired.** `bind_schedule_trigger` / `bind_app_event_trigger` / `bind_webhook_trigger`. Check `get_connector_events` first. **Before binding a SCHEDULE, ASK the user its cadence in business terms** — how fresh the data needs to be (e.g. every 15 min / hourly / nightly) and, for a daily/weekly job, the preferred run time + timezone. Pre-select a recommended default (from the freshness the plan implies), translate their answer into the cron/rate expression yourself, then bind. The trigger *type* stays your call; only the *cadence* is the user's. **This is the SAME live-safety pause as "ask before arming a schedule" — ask the cadence and confirm arming in one step; don't stop the user twice.** (See TRIGGER SELECTION below and EVENT-TRIGGERED WORKFLOWS in `references/workflow-patterns.md`.)

   **The bind call succeeding is NOT the trigger working.** For every trigger you bind, run the fire-and-correlate loop from the workflow-verifier skill (`workflow-verifier/references/verify-matrix.md` §2–§4) before reporting the build done: read the trigger back (schedule enabled with the approved cadence; app-event `subscriptionStatus` ACTIVE — retry the subscription once on FAILED, and surface `manualRegistrationRequired` + its `webhookUrl` as a BLOCKER, not a pass; webhook `triggerUrl` reachable) → fire it (scheduler run-now; a payloadSchema-shaped synthetic app event; a sample POST to the webhook URL) → find the execution the fire produced (`list_executions`, matching `requestHeaders["x-fastn-event-id"]` / the fire's `eventId`) → assert it completed with sane output. A fire that produced no execution is diagnosed at the trigger's monitoring/DLQ — never shrugged off, never left for the user to discover.
8. **CREATE THE WIDGET** — see below. EVERY integration ends here, then PHASE 4 — VERIFY closes the build.

## Step 8 — CREATE THE WIDGET (ONE per use case — the final step; EVERY build ends here)
**The widget is always created — single-tenant or multi-tenant.** What differs by path (SECOND AXIS in `SKILL.md` and `references/multi-tenancy.md`) is only the manifest scope, set in the Path-B precondition below; **Path A skips that precondition** (manifest stays all-`SAAS`) but still builds the widget.

**Path B precondition — set per-customer scope first (multi-tenant only).** When the use case ships to customers, BEFORE building the widget flip every connector that must run against the **customer's own account** to multi-tenant with `set_connector_scope { connectorSlug, scope: "MULTI_TENANT" }`, and leave shared/central systems as `SAAS` (mixed scope is normal — e.g. shared source `SAAS` + per-customer target `MULTI_TENANT`). Then exercise the real multi-tenant wiring with a **self-install** (`create_installation { endOrgId: <your own org>, connections: {…} }` → `test_workflow { installationId }` → `delete_installation`) before publishing. Full procedure: `references/multi-tenancy.md` §6–§8. **Path A (single-tenant) does NOT do this** — no `set_connector_scope`, no self-install — it goes straight to `create_widget`.

Once ALL workflows are built, tested, triggered, and scoped, finish by calling **`create_widget`** **exactly once** for the whole integration. **One use case → one widget.** It binds to the single `configId` that holds every entity pair's mappings, so all of them are configured in that one widget. NEVER create a widget per entity, per direction, or per workflow.

**⭐ PREFER UNIFIED — decide the widget's shape BEFORE picking `connectorIds`.** If the entity this use case moves is covered by a unified catalog entity across the connectors involved, the widget MUST be created as **UNIFIED** (attach the entity via `unifiedRefs`/`unifiedEntityIds`) — NOT as a plain APP widget wiring each provider as a separate connector, and NEVER as a widget per provider. Check first: `list_unified_categories` → `list_unified_entities`, and match the connectors' slugs against the entity's mappings (`connectorSlugs`). If one entity covers the data, attach that ONE entity (its mapped connectors auto-merge into the manifest, its catalog mappings become the config template — so do NOT also pass `configId`). Only fall back to plain `connectorIds` (an APP widget) when **no** unified entity covers the data. When a unified entity exists but the workflow code still calls per-provider `fastn.connector.*`, prefer `fastn.unified.<category>.<entity>.*` there too (see the **unified-api** skill and `SKILL.md` line on unified in workflow code) so the widget's unified config and the running flows stay consistent.

Common args:
- `name` = partner app + entity (e.g. "HubSpot Products"). Use the THIRD-PARTY app name — NEVER the user's own org-domain/company name, and NEVER append words like "Sync", "Initial Sync", "Integration". For a multi-entity use case, name it for the partner, not one entity.
- `connectorIds` = the UUIDs (from `list_connectors`) of ALL connectors the use case touches (1-3). EXCLUDE the user's own org-domain connector and its name from the widget — get the org domain via the `get_org_domain` tool, not by adding that connector.
- `workflowIds` = the `wf_*` of the workflows this widget publishes — binds each to every customer with a matching active connection. Pass ALL of the use case's flows here.
- `triggerIds` = the scheduler/webhook trigger IDs to publish (bound to customers the same way) — pass the triggers you bound in step 7.
- `syncDirection` = inbound / outbound / bidirectional for the integration as a whole.
- a short `description` and `agentContext` for the embed-side assistant.
- `status` defaults to `active`; pass `draft` to create without publishing.
- `unifiedEntityIds` = unified catalog entity (ue_* from `list_unified_entities`) to attach — **the preferred shape whenever a unified entity covers the data** (see PREFER UNIFIED above): attach the entity here INSTEAD of wiring the providers as separate `connectorIds`. **Attach exactly ONE entity per widget** (the dashboard picker enforces single category + single entity; config values are stored per provider, so two entities sharing a provider would collide). The entity's mapped connectors auto-merge into the manifest and its catalog mappings are snapshotted as the widget's config template — do NOT also pass `configId` in that case. The widget's `type` becomes `UNIFIED` (else `APP`). Use `unifiedRefs` instead of `unifiedEntityIds` to narrow the entity to a provider subset (`connectorSlugs`) and to define per-provider configuration forms (`configForm` — fields whose collected values merge into the provider action input at runtime, stored flat as `config.unifiedValues[connectorSlug][fieldKey]`; on update, an omitted `configForm` preserves the stored form). See the **unified-api** skill.

**Multi-tenant knobs (when the embed needs more than the defaults — full reference: `references/multi-tenancy.md` §11):**
- **Connector scope lives on the workflow MANIFEST, not on the widget** — set it with `set_connector_scope` (precondition above), never by an arg here. The widget's per-connector `slug` is just the key into each installation's connections map.
- `lifecycleHooks` — `{ onActivation, onDeactivation, onConfigurationCreated/Change/Delete }`, each → `{ workflowId, version?, enabled }`. Fire on install/uninstall and config changes; can veto or mutate config. Wire these when a customer connecting/disconnecting or editing config must trigger setup/teardown logic.
- `activationMode` — `SINGLE_ACTIVATION` (one install per customer — what the publish auto-fan-out creates; the default) vs `MULTI_CONNECTION` (several installs per customer via the embed, distinct slugs).
- `allowedEndOrgIds` — `null` = all customers (default), `[ids]` = restricted, `[]` = hidden.
- Publishing auto-binds already-connected customers and returns `sync: { installationsTouched, endOrgsCovered }` — report that count back.

Then branch on whether a config exists:
- **A config exists** (any data-movement integration from PHASE 2) → pass `configId` = the approved `configId` (from `check_config_status`). Passing `configId` IS the config binding — the widget links to the config automatically, and the call is idempotent (re-running returns the existing widget for that config). This closes the DYNAMIC CONFIG loop: the user edits every entity's mappings through this one widget and the running workflows read those edits next run.
- **No config** (a single-system workflow with no editable business rules, or any build that produced no `configId`) → OMIT `configId`. Bind the work via `workflowIds` (+ `triggerIds`), with `connectorIds` set to the connectors those flows call. A rules-bearing single-system automation belongs in the branch above — it has a `configId`, so the user gets the same editable filter/value page a sync does.

Do NOT skip this step, do NOT create the widget before the workflows are done, and do NOT create more than one.

**Read the widget BACK after creating it** (`get_widget`) and assert what the create call claimed: `workflowIds` carries every flow of the use case, `triggerIds` the bound triggers, `connectorIds` correct (org-domain connector excluded), `type` is `UNIFIED` when a unified entity was attached, the config template is linked (via `list_configs` — the widget row does not carry `configId`), and `list_widgets` shows no sibling widget covering the same use case. "The create call said so" is not linkage — the config-replacement bug note in `references/dynamic-config.md` exists because it wasn't.

## Step 9 — Verify, summarize, hand off
**First run PHASE 4 — VERIFY** (the workflow-verifier skill): the armed-system checks — every trigger fired and correlated to an execution (step 7's loop), widget readback (step 8), config liveness (edit a marker value, re-run, the run reflects it), one real `execute_workflow` per flow, connections ACTIVE and env-config keys resolving now, the **INTENT CONFORMANCE read-back** (verify-matrix §1c: re-read the built code fresh and diff what it ACTUALLY does against the user's request, the approved config, and the approved cases — missing intent, unrequested behavior, and silent reinterpretations are failures even when every case passes), and — for every data-moving flow — the **DATA PARITY audit** (verify-matrix §1b): count reconciliation (eligible = created + updated + explained skips, zero residue, target count matches), a field-by-field sample audit (source record → approved mapping → expected payload vs the record read back from the target), duplicate/idempotency probes, and one update-parity check. Self-heal what fails (max 3 attempts, full-suite re-run after any heal), then emit the **VERIFICATION REPORT** — rendered Markdown written for the use case's owner, template in the workflow-verifier skill: a plain-language verdict first, then What's running (one evidence row per surface: execution id / eventId / readback), Data parity (reconciled counts + sample-audit result + mismatch table), Failures (error + fix applied or proposed), Blockers as an actionable checklist (manual webhook registration URL, missing connection, secret-gated ingest), Coverage, Cleanup, Next steps. The report is mandatory on every build and every later update — a surface you could not verify goes under Failures or Blockers, never silently omitted.

Then close with a short, plain-language hand-off covering both:
- **How to test the flow** — the concrete way to run it now: for a backfill/batch, run it with a small bounded scope (`{ limit, maxPages }`) and check the run under the dashboard **Activity** tab (or via `list_executions` / `get_execution`); for an event flow, do the triggering action in the source app (and flag `manualRegistrationRequired` if the webhook still needs registering); for a schedule, say when it next runs. Give the direct execute endpoint for anything callable.
- **How to access the widget** — in the fastn dashboard, open the **Widgets** tab → the integration appears there; click its **Configure** button to edit the per-entity mappings and filters (saving there flows straight into the live workflows on the next run — no redeploy), and use the **Embed** tab to embed the widget in their own app.
- **Any leftover test data (orphans)** — if testing created records you could NOT delete (no delete action), list them here: what you created, where (connector + entity + id), and why it couldn't be removed, so the user can clean them up manually. Include this ONLY when orphans exist; if cleanup was complete, omit it.
Keep it to a few lines; this is the last thing the user sees.

## TRIGGER SELECTION
| Choice | When |
|---|---|
| Schedule only | batch reconcile, no events available, completeness > latency |
| Event only | one-record automation where a missed event is acceptable |
| Schedule + event | ongoing sync: events for latency, schedule for completeness (as TWO workflows) |
| Inbound webhook | workflow exposed as an HTTP endpoint for external callers |
| None | workflow is a callable API, invoked directly |

## EXECUTION TIERS (summary — full detail in `references/sandbox.md`)
- `instant` — synchronous return. Single-record / event-handler logic.
- `standard` — queued (202 + executionId). Loops, pagination, multi-call flows.
- `long` — separate queue. Historical imports, thousands of records.
